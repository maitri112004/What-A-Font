        <p class="dreamy">We Were Both Young When I First Saw You</p>
        <p class="nature">I close my eyes and the flashback starts</p>
        <p class="life">I'm standin' there</p>
        <p class="nature">On a balcony in summer air</p>
        <p class="nostalgia">See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns</p>
        <p class="life">See you make your way through the crowd </p>
        <p class="nature">And say, "Hello"</p>
        <p class="nostalgia">Little did I know</p>

        <p class="dreamy">That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles</p>
        <p class="nature">And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"</p>
        <p class="nature">And I was cryin' on the staircase</p>
        <p class="nostalgia">Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said</p>

        <p class="life">Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone</p>
        <p class="dreamy">I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run</p>
        <p class="dreamy">You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess</p>
        <p class="nostalgia">It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"</p>

        <p class="life">So I sneak out to the garden to see you</p>
        <p class="dreamy">We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew</p>
        <p class="nature ">So close your eyes</p>
        <p class="nostalgia">Escape this town for a little while, oh oh</p>
